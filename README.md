Assignment 1 for IMT2681 Cloud Computing

I can only apologize for the current state of this.
Due to a gross miscalculation in the amount of work
this assignment would be and similar mismanagement of
my time, at the time of writing most of the code 
is non-functional. The uptime ping works. That's about it.

I would very much appreciate an extension to fix it 
but that will of course be up to you.
